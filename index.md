The goal is to write about the projects I'm working on in order to better understand what I'm learning. They say you don't really know something until you can teach it to someone else, so this will be a way for me to both teach it to myself and maybe **(unlikely)** others too.
Some of the topics that I'll post about will include:
* General security topics
* Pentesting methodology/tools
* Programming
  ```python
  print("Mostly Python, but maybe some C# or C in the future...")
  ```
* Random thoughts or ideas

You get the idea.
